      "The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan. It houses the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, as well as his own tomb. The complex includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans and is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653. There is also a legend that Shah Jahan wanted to build a black marble mausoleum across the river from the Taj Mahal, called the Black Taj Mahal, but he was unable to complete it before his death.\n"
